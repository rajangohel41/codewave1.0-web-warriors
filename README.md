How It Works: Virtual Travel Assistant
User Input Collection:

When you open the app, you see a simple form where you enter:

Your travel destination (e.g., Paris).

The number of days you plan to stay.

Your interests (like food, history, nature).

Your budget preference (low, medium, high).

This form is designed to be quick and intuitive, so you can get started instantly.

Data Processing & Itinerary Generation:

Once you submit the form, the app takes your inputs and uses pre-loaded data:

A local dataset of attractions (famous landmarks, museums, parks).

Restaurants and cafés categorized by cuisine and price.

Local tips on transport, weather, and safety.

The app’s itinerary algorithm filters these places based on your preferences and budget.

For each day of your trip, it selects:

Morning, afternoon, and evening activities (combining popular spots and hidden gems).

A recommended restaurant or café matching your food preferences and budget.

Helpful local tips to make your travel smoother.

Displaying Your Personalized Itinerary:

The generated day-by-day plan is displayed on screen in a clean, mobile-friendly format.

Each day’s activities and dining options are clearly grouped.

Helpful local tips are highlighted for convenience.

Export & Sharing:

You can export your customized itinerary as a PDF file with one click.

This lets you easily save, print, or view your plan offline on any device during your trip.

Edit & Restart:

If you want to change your preferences or plan another trip, simply hit the “Edit Trip” button to go back and update your details.
